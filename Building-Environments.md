The PlatformIO configuration contains 4 environments for building and flashing your Ai-Thinker RGBW Light:

- '**env-dev**': development/debug environment for building and uploading the firmware via an FTDI (or alike) programmer
- '**env-prod**': production environment (optimized for size) for building and uploading the firmware via an FTDI (or alike) programmer

In addition, for each of these 2 environments, an OTA environment is available for uploading the firmware over OTA.
