The PlatformIO configuration contains 4 environments for building and flashing your Ai-Thinker LED RGBW light:

- '**env-dev**': development/debug environment for building and uploading the firmware via the AiLight Jig or an USB/UART (or equivalent) adapter
- '**env-prod**': production environment (optimized for size) for building and uploading the firmware via the AiLight Jig or an USB/UART (or equivalent) adapter

In addition, for each of these 2 environments, an **OTA** variant is available for uploading the firmware over OTA.
