## Incompatible Light Bulbs
Sometimes a light bulb's appearance (or it's product description) can be mistaken to be compatible. Unfortunately it is not always possible to see beforehand if the **AiLight** will work or not. The below table holds a list of light bulbs that are known **not** to be compatible.
