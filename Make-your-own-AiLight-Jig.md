The **AiLight** Jig is designed specifically for the Ai-Thinker LED RGBW light. It allows for uploading custom firmware without soldering any wires to the light’s PCB IO and test contacts. The Jig consists of 3 laser cut rings made out of wood: 2 upper rings [1] with designated holes for pogo pins, and a lower ring [2] acting as the base that fits snug into the light’s aluminum housing.
This kit consists of two parts: the wooden base and a USB to Serial Adapter (based on the CP2102 chipset) with pogo pins pre-soldered.
