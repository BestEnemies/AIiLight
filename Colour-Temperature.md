The AiLight firmware includes a nice feature that allows you to set the colour temperature of your Ai-Thinker Light bulb.

## What is Colour Temperature?
A way to think of the colour temperature is how 'warm' or 'cool' the white LED light is. Colour temperature is measured in degrees Kelvin and is a measure of the part of the color spectrum that is found in light. 

> The human eye is excellent at adjusting to different colour temperatures, which means that to you and me objects appear roughly the same colour whether they're outside in the sun or indoors under a lightbulb.

RGB LED's aren't as good at adapting as our human eye, and as a result they produce colours that may appear unnatural or even incorrect.

## How to use
The AiLight firmware contains two ways of setting the light's colour temperature; the first one is using the built-in Web UI and the second one is using Home Assistant.

1. AiLight Web UI
To set the light's colour temperature, simply move the colour temperature slider to the desired value. Possible values are from 154 to 500 (Mired)

2. Home Assistant
For setting the light's colour temperature in Home Assistant, it is assumed the appropriate configuration in Home Assistant is done. Click on your light's icon to have the configuration panel opened. Next, simply move the colour temperature slider to the desired value.
