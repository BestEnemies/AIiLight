The AiLight firmware includes a nice feature that allows you to set the colour temperature of your Ai-Thinker Light bulb.

## What is Colour Temperature?
The human eye is excellent at adjusting to different colour temperatures, which means that to you and me objects appear roughly the same colour whether they're outside in the sun or indoors under a lightbulb.
RGB LED's aren't as good at adapting as our human eye, and as a result they produce colours that may appear unnatural or perhaps incorrect.
