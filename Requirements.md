Starting with **AiLight** is pretty easy, and you only need a couple of items (and a bit of spare time)

## Hardware
* An **Ai-Thinker RGBW LED bulb** (or equivalent). These are available from Amazon, eBay or AliExpress and can carry different names. An easy way to find them is to do an online search for the Tuya Smart App, or search on these shopping sites using the keyword 'M1636'. In addition, it is good to check if the light uses the ESP8266 MCU (not always given in the product descriptions though)
* An **USB/UART FTDI** (or equivalent) adapter.
* Micro USB to USB cable
* or an **AiLight Jig**. If you feel your soldering skills are not up to par, I have designed a special jig that saves you considerable time. You can find more details here: [AiLight Jig](https://www.sachatelgenhof.nl/blog/ailight-jig)

## Software
To build and upload **AiLight** you need to have the following tools installed on your environment:
* [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* Optionally, you need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) in case you would like to compile the embedded Web UI yourself. 

Please check the respective websites for installation instructions.
