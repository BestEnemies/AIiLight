Welcome to the AiLight wiki! You can find various topics in the sidebar on the right.

*AiLight* is a custom firmware for the hackable, inexpensive Ai-Thinker RGBW WiFi light bulbs that has an ESP8266 at its core. Ai-Thinker RGBW WiFi light bulbs are being made by a Chinese company called Ai-Thinker and are available across many e-commerce sites like Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, etc.

So, why a custom firmware?

* You can add functionality the original manufacturer hasn't thought of (yet)
* You can integrate with other devices or systems like for example Home Assistant
* You can ensure it is private (only you know when the lights are on)
* It is a great project to learn something new... and it is super fun!
